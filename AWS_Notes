What is Cloud Computing?
--> using remote server on the internet to store, process data insted of putting on local machine.

AWS Compute Services.
-----------------------

EC2:- ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD (we will get blank server. and we would need to install from o.s. to rest of required appilcations.)
Lambda:- this is just for background processing. e.g. image compression. etc based on the events triggered. we can define triggers.
Elastic Beans:- this is automatic version of EC2, which provides ready environment where we can deploy our code directly . 
				this allows us to select environment required like php/java then aws will create readymade environment 
				and we will be ready to deploy our application.
Elastic Load Balencer:- this is used to distribute the load amongst the different instances of EC2/ Elastic Beans				

Autoscaling :- We can Auto scale our instances when work load is huge. Autoscaling works with Elastic Load Balencer.
				
				

AWS Storage Services.
------------------------

s3:- Simple Storage Service. it is object oriented file storage system.
CloudFront :- it is used to cache the sites/ some data  so that response time would be less.
Elastic Block Storage (EBS) :- EC2's are backed by EBS. one EC2 can have multiple EBS. but vice versa is not possible.
Glacier:- glacier is data backup/ archiving service.
Snowball :- snowball service is related to data-transfer physically from one AWS Infrastructure to other AWS Infrastructure. snowball is physical device.
