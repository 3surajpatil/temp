What is Cloud Computing?
--> using remote server on the internet to store, process data insted of putting on local machine.

AWS Compute Services.
-----------------------

EC2:- ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD (we will get blank server. and we would need to install from o.s. to rest of required appilcations.)
Lambda:- this is just for background processing. e.g. image compression. etc based on the events triggered. we can define triggers.
Elastic Beans:- this is automatic version of EC2, which provides ready environment where we can deploy our code directly . 
				this allows us to select environment required like php/java then aws will create readymade environment 
				and we will be ready to deploy our application.
Elastic Load Balencer:- this is used to distribute the load amongst the different instances of EC2/ Elastic Beans				

Autoscaling :- We can Auto scale our instances when work load is huge. Autoscaling works with Elastic Load Balencer.
				
				

AWS Storage Services.
------------------------

s3:- Simple Storage Service. it is object oriented file storage system.
CloudFront :- it is used to cache the sites/ some data  so that response time would be less.
Elastic Block Storage (EBS) :- EC2's are backed by EBS. one EC2 can have multiple EBS. but vice versa is not possible.
Glacier:- glacier is data backup/ archiving service.
Snowball :- snowball service is related to data-transfer physically from one AWS Infrastructure to other AWS Infrastructure. snowball is physical device.
Storage Gateway:- this is placed in between application server and database server . it acts as a middleware.
	it takes snapshot of database in some time interval. and it will identify if there is any failure of database server and
	restore the database snapshot.				

AWS Database Services.
------------------------
1) RDS:- Relational Database Management System. we can manage relational databases like oracle , mysql etc.
2) Aurora :- amazon aurora is again mysql based RDBMS service . that means it is same as mysql but 5 times faster than mysql . 
			 mysql code will work exactly same in this service.
3) DynamoDB :- it is non RDBMS service.it will increase database size automatically , no manual intervention. 
			as more data comes in. this is for unstructured data. i.e. non RDBMS.
			
4) Elastic Cache :- it identifies frequent queries and cache data. queries will be served from here insted of hitting database frequently.
5) Redshift :- this is data analysis tool. here data can be feeded from RDS & DynamoDB. 

AWS Networking Services.
--------------------------
1) VPC :- virtual private cloud. we can put all our resources in VPC so that they can communicate with each other.
2) Direct Connect :- if we want more bandwidth than our regular internet. then we can use this service and opt one lease line and have more bandwidth.
3) Route53 :- this is DNS service. we can provide name or alias and ip address to the AWS instance.


AWS Management Services.
---------------------------
1) CloudWatch :- we can set alarms and monitor our instances.
2) CloudFormation :- we can use this service as a template for creating new could infrastructure.e.g  we can copy our existing could and make new one.
3) CloudTrail:- it is a logging service. stores logs in s3 file systems.
4) CLI :- it is replacement to aws GUI.
5) OpsWorks :- configuration management tool.
6) TrustedAdvisor :- advises to create better aws account and reduce cost.


AWS Security Services.
-----------------------------
1) IAM :- identification and Authentication tool. we can create multiple accounts as user or admin.
2) KMS :- this service helps creating public and private keys.


AWS Application Services.
------------------------------

1) SES :- email services.
2) SQS :- simple queue service. it allows to create tasks and those will be processed by different servers with listed priority as FIFO.
3) SNS :- simple notification service. it allows to send notification. e.g. sending notification to SQS after processing one task.


AWS Pricing.
------------------
known intervals for instance and resources could lead in cost reduction.
